'''

Class Methods - Allows operations related to the class itself
                Takes (cls) as the first parameter/argument, which represents the class itself.
                (self) are used for instance methods that refer to any instances/objects from that class.

Instance methods - Best for operations on instances of that class (object/instance)
Static methods â€” Best for utility functions that do not need access to class data.
