Module = A file containing code you want to include in your program
         Use 'import' to include a module (built-in or your own)
         Useful to break up a large program into reusable separate files.
Variable scope = where a variable is visible and accessible
Scope resolution = (LEGB) Local -> Enclosed -> Global -> Built-In

Main functions can be imported or run standalone
Functions and classes in this module can be reused without the main block executing.
